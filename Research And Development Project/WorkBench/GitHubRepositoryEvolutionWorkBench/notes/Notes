getting commits dynamically has many issues

1. overlapping ajax calls when multiple projects are input, the requests then compete and makes it impossible to track responses
2. overlapping requests cause variables that I would normally rely on to change, so theres no way of identifying destination variables
3. The sheer amount of time if multiple commits are input
4. synchronous is not an option

as a result I am making the commits and on demand service, that the user selects manually. outside of the normal load json process.
