TODO:

document + verify
1. full test
2. UI is too sterile for the subject, more character required
4. upload schema to GIT
7. evaluate and get feedback on database schema structure
15. fill db with realistic data
17. take screenshots
18. write read me in full

to fix
11. security to prevent hackers using username to navigate urls with query params
- create a profile id that is a randomly generated number which lowers risk of navigating illegally, say 20 chars. use that string as param for querys

potential ideas
13. check if map conversion is required. is request.get param not suffucient? (could also pass in multible params in ajax instead of object)
14. remember me cookie?
22. add ajax method to master and just take multible parameters and return reponse for logic handling
23. check if user on system method very similar to read and compare
- add ssl
-look into way to see if cookies can improve the app design
sql injection
