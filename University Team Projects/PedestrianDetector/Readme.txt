Hi Jesus

- to get the same results (use same images that we did) as the report unzip the image folders in system/dataset/images/pos & system/dataset/images/pos file paths

- run the system using the 'main' function
	- on a full dataset this may take some time

- the plot folder is a subsystem which plots graphs based on the training and testing data which you can also run and view if requied

- in the report folder a videos have been provided

- a spreadsheet is provided which shows the collated training and testing data in full
