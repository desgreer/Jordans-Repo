- over 50% affinity to the language
- LOC is calculate using darwin (look at net tools to see it) - gives me the api claim
- chose projects using github search language and star amount
- search in a range  stars:"100..900"
-select randomly based on what is returned in order by github
- 12 instances each language so 120
- some langauges (python did not have enough stars for some of the categories, so were padded elsewhere)
